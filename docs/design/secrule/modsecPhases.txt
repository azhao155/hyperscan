Note on phases:
    Numbers to names:
        re_actions.c line 764
            1              REQUEST_HEADERS
            2 "request"    REQUEST_BODY
            3              RESPONSE_HEADERS
            4 "response"   RESPONSE_BODY
            5 "logging"    LOGGING
    REQUEST-912-DOS-PROTECTION.conf does something special with phases, but we will not build dos protection into the secrule engine

    Can we just ignore phases?
        Yes, I think they can just be ignored.
        Phases may have been useful once for short circuiting, but with an score based system anyway it doesn't have any benefit.
        Phases are also useful to determine which body parser to use, but rather than letting this be rule driving we can probably just hardcode this.
